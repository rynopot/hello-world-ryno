# hello-world-ryno
My first github repository
I am 45 year old developer that got into Programming in my 30's.
I was trained in Java at a company called Van Zyl & Pritchard, where you have class Mon - thu, and Fridays were test Day - without a computer.
The test were: paper based.  You had to print out all your code of that week, and then you had to take it with you.

The tests were open book - which wasn't much help.  You still had to think how to do the code...
